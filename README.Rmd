# evalImg

Install with devtools-package: `devtools::install_github("torden81/evalImg")`


You need to copy the image files to be rated as jpg to the folder whatever gives you `system.file("app/www", package = "evalImg")`.
After installation you can start the Shiny app with `evalImg::run_app()`.

Reading of the evaluation files can be done with `evalImg::readEvalFiles()` as a base for further analysis.
